title: An Informative Adaptive Receptive Field Model for Recurrent Neural Networks
---
Recently, the development of Information Bottleneck Theory has significantly promoted understandability of deep neural network. However, few works talks about recurrent neural network from this perspective. We introduce a mechanism for RNN called adaptive receptive field, which focuses on the preliminary treatment for input subsequence by adaptively adjusting the size of receptive field and processing the input subsequence in the field. Analysis and experiments show that the size of receptive field is related to both sufficiency and min- imum principle of information bottleneck theory, which thus can be uesd as an auxiliary parts to promote comprehension of RNN from information bottleneck perspective. Experiments also reveal that our architecture for RNN can obviously im- prove the performance of baseline models.
