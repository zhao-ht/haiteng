title: A Computational Model of mPFC and HPC for Context Structure of Episodic Memory
---
Hippocampus and mPFC are important neural structures for context processing in episodic memory. The processing is combined with both positive and negative phase differences of theta oscillation between two structures. This paper attempts to give a possible theoretical explanation for the function of mPFC and hippocampus in the context structure problem of episodic memory, as well as the theta oscillation phenomenon, by a computational model. We define the context structure problem as minimum average cut problem of network. We propose a computational model which is based on the the biological structure and relationship of mPFC and hippocampus. Then we show how this model is related to the minimum cut problem, which is a possible theoretical explanation for the relationship between biological structure and its function. We also analyzed the dynamic characteristics of the model, which contains two kinds of oscillations and shows both positive and negative phase differences. This further explained the positive and negative phase differences of theta oscillation of hippocampus and mPFC.
